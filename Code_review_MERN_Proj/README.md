## 🧱 Tech Stack

### 🛠️ Backend
- **Node.js** – The server backbone, handling routes and API calls like a champ.
- **Google Gemini** – The brain of the operation.
- **Model**: `gemini-2.0-flash` – Blazing-fast, opinionated, and not afraid to roast your code.

### 🌐 Frontend
- **React.js** – Because vanilla JS is for brave souls.
- **Hooks & Tools**:
  - `useState` – Managing state like it’s 2025.
  - `axios` – Talking to the backend with no awkward silences.
  - `prism` – For highlighting your syntax sins.
  - `rehype-highlight` – Making markdown and code reviews beautiful (or brutally honest).
